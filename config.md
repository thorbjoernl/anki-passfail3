**button_labels** (Default: ["Fail", "Pass"]): A list of labels that will be used for the buttons. Can be used to translate the labels to your local language, or to use different labels.

**debug** (Default: false): Enables popup-messages after each review that explain why and how a card was graded. Can be used to verify that the add-on is configured correctly.

**decks** (Default: []): A list of deck names. Note that nested decks are not automatically included. Including "Main" does *not* apply to "Main::A"; each subdeck must be listed individually.

**mode** (Default: "whitelist"): Sets how the deck list should be interpreted. If whitelist timebased grading *only* applies to the listed decks. If blacklist timebased grading applies to *all* decks except the listed ones.
